# streamlink.Python.Twitch.Automated.Download
automated python script to fetch your clipboard(URL) then download Twitch streams via Streamlink, asking what to name/what size

This is MY FIRST Ever script written be easy on me

Made this because got sick of manually entering it into notpad where i hade the string saved then into Cmd

Do with it what you will.

How it works:
Ir will grab your clipboards (Copy/ctrl+c) Last entrie (so copy URL of thing you want to download first)

Chop off problem end of url string (if from twitch)

Checks your folders if Streamlinks installed (if not gives links or opens links)

Asks where to save

Asks what resolution you want to download into

Then opens in cmd all the string to be able to download your clipboard.
