HOW/WHY
# [Streamlink][streamlink-website] Dependant** Automated Downloader

Automated python script to fetch your clipboard(URL) then download (Twitch vods mostly for me) streams/video via Streamlink (all restrictions still inplace Eg YT Music DMCA), asking what to name/what size.

This is MY FIRST Ever script, written 5 days into python.

Made this because i got sick of manually entering it into notpad where i had the string saved then into Cmd

How it works: It will grab your clipboards (Copy/ctrl+c) Last entrie (so copy URL of thing you want to download first)

Chop off problem end of url string (if from twitch copied from a specific way)

Checks your folders if Streamlinks installed (if not gives links or opens links to streamlink)

Asks where to save

Asks what resolution you want to download into

Downloads Video

Asks if you want to Combine it (chunks problem) into another file (ffmpeg)

Done, want to play again.

Yes there are other options out there easier/better but this works for me and does exactly what i want it to. + i made it :)

mainly using Github to sync my separate pc to work on it
