HOW/WHY
# [Streamlink][streamlink-website] Dependant** Automated Downloader

Automated python script to fetch your clipboard(URL) then download streams/video via Streamlink (streamlink restrictions apply), asking what to name/what size.

Made this because i got sick of manually entering it into notpad where i had the string saved then into Cmd

How it works: It will grab your clipboards (Copy/ctrl+c) Last entrie (so copy URL of thing you want to download first)

Checks your folders if Streamlinks/ffmpeg installed (if not gives links or opens links to streamlink/can auto download ffmpeg)

Asks where to save

Asks what resolution you want to download into

Downloads Video

Asks if you want to Combine it (chunks problem) into another file (ffmpeg)

Can Also extract Audio/Video from each other (Vp9/Opus included)
