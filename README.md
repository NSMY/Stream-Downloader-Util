HOW/WHY

# StreamLink Dependant** Automated Downloader
automated python script to fetch your clipboard(URL) then download (Twitch mostly for me) streams/video via Streamlink, asking what to name/what size

This is MY FIRST Ever script, written 3 days into python.

Made this because i got sick of manually entering it into notpad where i had the string saved then into Cmd

How it works:
It will grab your clipboards (Copy/ctrl+c) Last entrie (so copy URL of thing you want to download first)

Chop off problem end of url string (if from twitch copied from a specific way)

Checks your folders if Streamlinks installed (if not gives links or opens links to streamlink)

Asks where to save

Asks what resolution you want to download into

Then opens in cmd all the combined string to be able to download your clipboard.

Yes there are other options out there easier/better but this works for me and does exactly what i want it to. + i made it :)
